# Plot-Graph
This is a demo for a plot graph that can take a list of ints of x and y coordinates and plot a line of the coordinates on the graph. The program generates evenly spaces column and row labeles so that they increment evenly.
Once that has been calculated the graph program can accurately plot the point that was given. The graph can also be modified to handle to have more or less lines and the size of the graph can also be set. 

# Example
This input is a mock up to demo how the graph works at a fixed scale allowing the user to input up to 12 x coordinates and 12 y coordinates. There must be same amount of x coordinates as y coordinates and there must be aleast 3 x and y coordinates entered for it to plot the graph.

When the user hits the Plot graph button the user will be taken to a screen that shows the button and creates a graph of the inputted coordinates.
